Simple BLAST algorithm that takes in two sequences 
that were created by https://web.expasy.org/randseq and 
searches for similarities or mutations element by element.

**Features**
- Choose between three search modes:
  - Sequence matches
  - Sequence mutations
  - Defined sequence
- Variable Input region (start + stop position)

- Output of sequence length 
- Output of position of findings ("X123Y") (for matches / mutations)
- Output of total amount of findings (for matches / mutations)
